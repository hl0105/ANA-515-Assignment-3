# ANA-515-Assignment-3
This project is for ANA-515-Assignment, which describes the storm events by states in USA. I used the data from NOAA's Storm Events Database, "StormEvents_details-ftp_v1.0_d1997_c20220425.csv.gz", since I borned in 1997.
In this dataset, we have storm events start date and end date, associated deaths, and property damage. 
Thanks for reviewing!
